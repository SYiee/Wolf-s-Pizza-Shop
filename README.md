## üìã Game introduction


</aside>

> `Motivation`
> 

Usually, fairy tales contain **lessons for children** in self-forming periods. I thought that I would have a more fun and realistic experience if I **became the main character and enjoyed the fairy tale through VR devices** rather than watching the fairy tale through books or watching the fairy tale through videos. Therefore, we planned a **VR content book for children aged 5-10 years**.  

<br/>

The <b>"Wolf'S Pizza Shop"</b> aimed to teach children **three major lessons**.

1. Breaking down the stereotype that wolves are villains.
2. Public etiquette
3. How to recognize and apologize for your mistakes and how to forgive them.
<br/>

> `Story Scenario`
> 

**‚úÖ Scene1**

A wolf opens a pizza shop in a village where three little pigs and animals live. I'm heading to the pizza store to open the store.
<br/>  

**‚úÖ Scene2**
  
The wolf cleans the store and prepares to open it. On the first day of the opening, the little pigs show up and make a mess of the shop.
 <br/> 
  
**‚úÖ Scene3**  

On the second day of the store opening, the wolf heads to the pizza store. Wolves open the store and watch CCTV installed inside the store at the office. While observing CCTV, whenever pigs cause an accident, press the button to warn them.
  <br/>  

**‚úÖ Scene4**

When pigs are warned by wolves, they realize their mistakes and apologize to wolves. The story ends with wolves forgiving the pigs and reconciling.

## üìå Game Features

> `Mini Game`
> 

#### üßπ cleaning game

- **cleaning the floor with a mop**
    
    When you get close to the mop, a round button appears on the mop, and when you press the button, the mop is automatically mounted on your hand. Rubbing a mop on a stain on the floor will remove the stain and make it clean.
    
- **putting the trash in the trash can**
    
    When you get close to the garbage bag, a round button pops up and you press the button on the controller and you automatically get it. If you put trash in the trash can, it automatically disappears and you can clean the store cleanly.
    
  
  </br>

#### üì∏ CCTV game  
  
    
    
- **Watching pigs on CCTV**
    
    Triple monitor shows the current store from three different angles. If pigs cause an accident, the border of CCTV footage will be marked red.
    
    ‚Üí The reason why it is expressed on CCTV, not in the actual store, is **"VR motion sickness"**. In fact, many people feel motion sickness in VR 6-DoF, which is designed to be observed in **3-DoF** format to prevent it.
    

- **Press the button to warn the pigs**
    
    If you press the button at the exact time when pigs cause an accident while observing CCTV, the pigs in CCTV expand and play an embarrassing animation. This can alert the pigs. The buttons are actually designed to go in when pressed by hand, and the controller has a weak vibration to give the player the feeling of pressing the button.
